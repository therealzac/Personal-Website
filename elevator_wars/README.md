# ELEVATOR WARS

Elevator Wars is a Javascript game that teaches people Javascript.

[Check it out live here.]

## Education Philosophy

- The behavior of the elevator in the 1st level can be understood easily by a non programmer after looking at the code.

- Users learn javascript by tweaking pre-existing syntax.

- More advanced levels require reference to documentation that details the properties of elevators and floors.

## Challenges

- A new game mechanic is introduced in each of the beginning levels.

- Game mechanics are combined in later levels.

## Future Improvements

- Tweaking difficulty.

- Adding a challenge builder so that users can create and share custom challenges.
